# Github Guide

## To contribute in project:
1. Go to designated repository and copy the repository url by clicking `Code`
2. Open your terminal
```
# Clone repository
git clone <repository_url>

# Navigate the clone repository on your device
cd <repository_name>
```
3. You may now start working

# Two ways to upload your code:

## Main branch coding:
The main branch is the central branch where the primary version of the project resides. It is often considered the "production-ready" or "stable" version of the code. When coding directly in the main branch, all changes made to this branch will immediately affect the codebase as a whole. These changes can impact the entire project, including other branches that may later merge with the main branch.
After making changes to the code:
```
# Add the code to stage
git add -A

# Commit changes
git commit -m "{commit message}"

# Send the changes
git push
```
1. Add changes to the staging area (files you will commit) using `git add .` or `git add -A.`
2. Commit changes using `git commit -m "{commit message}"`. Make sure your commit messages are descriptive.
3. Push your changes to your fork using `git push`.

## Alternate branch coding (Recommended):
A branch acts as a separate workspace, allowing you to work on specific features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main branch or other developersâ€™ work. This isolation helps prevent introducing bugs or unfinished code into the main project. Branches also simplify collaboration by enabling multiple developers to work on different tasks simultaneously without interference.

```
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>

# Upload changes
git add -A
git commit -m "{commit message}"
git push origin <new_branch_name>

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge with main branch
git merge <{new_branch_name}>

# Pull latest version
git pull origin main
```
1. Create and switch a new branch using `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`. You can decide what the branch name.
2. Upload the changes and wait for the approval from the owner of the repository.
3. Switch branch using `git checkout <branch_name>`. After pushing the changes, change to `main` branch
4. Merge main and chosen branch using `git merge <{new_branch_name}>`. Change `{new_branch_name} with branch you want to merge with main.
5. Update the clone repository using `git pull origin main` if the repository is updated.
